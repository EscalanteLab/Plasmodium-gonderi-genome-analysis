# *Plasmodium gonderi* genome analysis

This repository hosts the custom scripts and analysis of the *Plasmodium gonderi* genome, a parasite found in African monkeys, and its implications for understanding the evolution of malaria-causing *Plasmodium* species in humans. Our work focuses on a *de novo* assembled genome and comparative genomics of *P. gonderi*, which is unique among parasites from African old-world monkeys for not being found in African Apes.

## Key Highlights:

**Genomic Comparison:** The *P. gonderi* genome exhibits similarities with human parasites *Plasmodium ovale* s.l. and *Plasmodium malariae*, as well as *Plasmodium vivax* and nonhuman primate parasites in Southeast Asia.


**Genomic Characteristics:** We explore the codon usage, syntenic blocks, and gene families, highlighting the evolutionary trajectory of these parasites.


**Evolutionary Insights:** Our analysis includes phylogenetic studies and time estimates, shedding light on the ancestral relationships and geographical origins of various *Plasmodium* species, including the lineage of *P. vivax*.


**Host-Parasite Interaction:** We identify regions in the genome correlating with the parasite's ability to adapt and colonize vertebrate hosts, providing insights into the host-Plasmodium evolutionary dynamics.
